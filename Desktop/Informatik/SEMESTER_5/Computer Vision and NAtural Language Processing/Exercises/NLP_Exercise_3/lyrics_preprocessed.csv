ballad of donald white my name is donald white you see i stand before you all i was judged by you a murderer and the hangmans knot must fall i will die upon the gallows pole when the moon is shining clear and these are my final words that you will ever hear i left my home in kansas when i was very young i landed in the old northwest seattle washington although id atraveled many miles i never made a friend for i could never get along in life with people that i met if i had some education to give me a decent start i might have been a doctor or a master in the arts but i used my hands for stealing when i was very young and they locked me down in jailhouse cells thats how my life begun oh the inmates and the prisoners i found they were my kind and it was there inside the bars i found my peace of mind but the jails they were too crowded institutions overflowed so they turned me loose to walk upon lifes hurried tangled road and theres danger on the ocean where the salt sea waves split high and theres danger on the battlefield where the shells of bullets fly and theres danger in this open world where men strive to be free and for me the greatest danger was in society so i asked them to send me back to the institution home but they said they were too crowded for me they had no room i got down on my knees and begged “oh please put me away” but they would not listen to my plea or nothing i would say and so it was on christmas eve in the year of  it was on that night i killed a man i did not try to hide the jury found me guilty and i wont disagree for i knew that it would happen if i wasnt put away and im glad ive had no parents to care for me or cry for now they will never know the horrible death i die and im also glad ive had no friends to see me in disgrace for

talk but his mouth could hardly move and the mother had to turn her face away “dont you remember ma when i went off to war you thought it was the best thing i could do i was on the battleground you were home acting proud you wasnt there standing in my shoes” “oh and i thought when i was there god what am i doing here im atryin to kill somebody or die tryin but the thing that scared me most was

and through the roar and smoke this string is finally broke and a cannonball blew my eyes away” as he turned away to walk his ma was still in shock at seein the metal brace that helped him stand but

insane” he grabbed my arm i said “ouch” as i landed on the psychiatric couch he said “tell me about it” well the whole thing started at oclock fast it was all over by quarter past i was down in the sewer with some little lover when i peeked out from a manhole cover wondering who turned the lights on well i got up and walked around and up and down the lonesome town i stood awondering which way to go i lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road it was a normal day well i rung the fallout shelter bell and i leaned my head and i gave a yell “give me a string bean im a hungry man” a shotgun fired and away i ran i dont blame them too much though i know i look funny down at the corner by a hotdog stand i seen a man i said “howdy friend i guess theres just us two” he screamed a bit and away he flew thought i was a communist well i spied a girl and before she could leave “lets go and play adam and eve” i took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin when she said “hey man you crazy or sumpin you see what happened last time they started” well i seen a cadillac window uptown and there was nobody aroun i got into the drivers seat and i drove down nd street in my cadillac good car to drive after a war well i remember seein some ad so i turned on my conelrad but i didnt pay my con ed bill so the radio didnt work so well turned on my record player— it was rockaday johnny singin “tell your ma tell your pa our loves agonna grow oohwah oohwah” i was feelin kinda lonesome and blue i needed somebody to talk to so i called up the operator of time just to hear a voice of some kind “when you hear the beep it will be three oclock” she said that for over an hour and i hung up well the doctor interrupted me just about then sayin “hey ive been havin the same old dreams but mine was a little different you see i dreamt that the only person left after the war was me i didnt see you around” well now time passed and now it seems everybodys having them dreams everybody sees themselves walkin around with no one else half of the people can be part right all of the time some of the people can be all right part of the time but all of the people cant be all right all of the time i think abraham lincoln said that “ill let you be in my dreams if i can be in yours” i said that,dylan,talkin world war iii blues some time ago a crazy dream came to me i

chimes of freedom far between sundowns finish an midnights broken toll we ducked inside the doorway thunder crashing as majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds seeming to be the chimes of

gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales for the disrobed faceless forms of no position tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts all down in takenforgranted situations tolling for the deaf an blind tolling for the mute tolling for the mistreated mateless mother the mistitled prostitute for the misdemeanor outlaw chased an cheated by pursuit an we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing even though a clouds white curtain in a faroff corner flashed an the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail for the lonesomehearted lovers with too personal a tale an for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail an we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing starryeyed an laughing as i recall when we were caught trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended as we listened one last time an we watched with one last look spellbound an swallowed til the tolling ended tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be

motorpsycho nightmare i pounded on a farmhouse lookin for a place to stay i was mighty mighty tired i had come a long long way i said “hey hey in there is there anybody home” i was standin on the steps feelin most alone well out comes a farmer he must have thought that i was nuts he immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts i fell down to my bended knees saying “i dig farmers dont shoot me please” he cocked his rifle and began to shout “youre that travelin salesman that i have heard about” i said “no no no im a doctor and its true im a cleancut kid and i been to college too” then in comes his daughter whose name was rita she looked like she stepped out of la dolce vita i immediately tried to cool it with her dad and told him what a nice pretty farm he had he said “what do doctors know about farms pray tell” i said “i was born at the bottom of a wishing well” well by the dirt neath my nails i guess he knew i wouldnt lie “i guess youre tired” he said kinda sly i said “yes ten thousand miles today i drove” he said “i got a bed for you underneath the stove just one condition and you go to sleep right now that you dont touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cow” i was sleepin like a rat when i heard something jerkin there stood rita lookin just like tony perkins she said “would you like to take a shower ill show you up to the door” i said “oh no no ive been through this before” i knew i had to split but i didnt know how when she said “would you like to take that shower now” well i couldnt leave unless the old man chased me out cause id already promised that id milk his cows i had to say something to strike him very weird so i yelled out “i like fidel castro and his beard” rita looked offended but she got out of the way as he came charging down the stairs sayin “whats that i heard you say” i said “i like fidel castro i think you heard me right” and ducked as he swung at me with all his might rita mumbled something bout her mother on the hill as his fist hit the icebox he said hes going to kill me if i dont get out the door in two seconds flat “you unpatriotic rotten doctor commie rat” well he threw a readers digest at my head and i did run i did a somersault as i seen him get his gun and crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour and landed fully blast in his garden flowers rita said “come back” as he started to load the sun was comin up and i was runnin down the road well i dont figure ill be back there for a spell even though rita moved away and got a job in a motel he still waits for me constant on the sly he

ballad in plain d i once loved a girl her skin it was bronze with the innocence of a lamb she was gentle like a fawn i courted her proudly but now she is gone gone as the season shes taken through young summers breeze i stole her away from her mother and sister though close did they stay each one of them suffering from the failures of their day with strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us of the two sisters i loved the young with sensitive instincts she was the creative one the constant scapegoat she was easily undone by the jealousy of others around her for her parasite sister i had no respect bound by her boredom her pride to protect countless visions of the other shed reflect as a crutch for her scenes and her society myself for what i did i cannot be excused the changes i was going through cant even be used for the lies that i told her in hopes not to lose the couldbe dreamlover of my lifetime with unknown consciousness i possessed in my grip a magnificent mantelpiece though its heart being chipped noticing not that id already slipped to a sin of loves false security from silhouetted anger to manufactured peace answers of emptiness voice vacancies till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but “please whats wrong and whats exactly the matter” and so it did happen like it could have been foreseen the timeless explosion of fantasys dream at the peak of the night the king and the queen tumbled all down into pieces “the tragic figure” her sister did shout “leave her alone god damn you get out” and i in my armor turning about and nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound her sister and i in a screaming battleground and she in between the victim of sound soon shattered as a child neath her shadows all is gone all is gone admit it take flight i gagged twice doubled tears blinding my sight my mind it was mangled i ran into the night leaving all of loves ashes behind me the wind knocks my window the room it is wet the words to say im sorry i havent found yet i think of her often and hope whoever shes met will be fully aware of how precious she is ah my friends from the prison they ask unto me “how good how good does it feel to be free” and i answer them most mysteriously “are birds free from the chains of the skyway”,dylan,ballad in plain d i once loved a girl her skin it was

bob dylans th dream i was riding on the mayflower when i thought i spied some land i yelled for captain arab i have yuh understand who came running to the deck said “boys forget the whale look on over yonder cut the engines change the sail haul on the bowline” we sang that melody like all tough sailors do when they are far away at sea “i think ill call it america” i said as we hit land i took a deep breath i fell down i could not stand captain arab he started writing up some deeds he said “lets set up a fort and start buying the place with beads” just then this cop comes down the street crazy as a loon he throw us all in jail for carryin harpoons ah me i busted out dont even ask me how i went to get some help i walked by a guernsey cow who directed me down to the bowery slums where people carried signs around saying “ban the bums” i jumped right into line sayin “i hope that im not late” when i realized i hadnt eaten for five days straight i went into a restaurant lookin for the cook i told them i was the editor of a famous etiquette book the waitress he was handsome he wore a powder blue cape i ordered some suzette i said “could you please make that crepe” just then the whole kitchen exploded from boilin fat food was flying everywhere and i left without my hat now i didnt mean to be nosy but i went into a bank to get some bail for arab and all the boys back in the tank they asked me for some collateral and i pulled down my pants they threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from france who invited me to her house i went but she had a friend who knocked me out and robbed my boots and i was on the street again well i rapped upon a house with the us flag upon display i said “could you help me out i got some friends down the way” the man says “get out of here ill tear you limb from limb” i said “you know they refused jesus too” he said “youre not him get out of here before i break your bones i aint your pop” i decided to have him arrested and i went looking for a cop i ran right outside and i hopped inside a cab i went out the other door this englishman said “fab” as he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood parked across from a building advertising brotherhood i ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does but it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who i was i repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh he gave me his card he said “call me if they die” i shook his hand and said goodbye ran out to the street when a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet a pay phone was ringing it just about blew my mind when i picked it up and said hello this foot came through the line well by this time i was fed up at tryin to make a stab at bringin back any help for my friends and captain arab i decided to flip a coin like either heads or tails would let me know if i should go back to ship or back to jail so i hocked my sailor suit and i got a coin to flip it came up tails it rhymed with sails so i made it back to the ship well i got back and took the parkin ticket off the mast i was ripping it to shreds when this coastguard boat went past they asked me my name and i said “captain kidd” they believed me but they wanted to know what exactly that i did i said for the pope of eruke i was employed they let me go right away they were very paranoid well the last i heard of arab he was stuck on a whale that was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail but the funniest thing was when i was leavin the bay i saw three ships asailin they were all heading my way i asked the captain what his name was and how come he didnt drive a truck he said his name was columbus i just said “good luck”,dylan,bob dylans th dream i was riding on the mayflower when i thought i spied some

its alright ma im only bleeding darkness at the break of noon shadows even the silver spoon the handmade blade the childs balloon eclipses both the sun and moon to understand you know too soon there

all that should be killed to crawl while others say dont hate nothing at all except hatred disillusioned words like bullets bark as human gods aim for their mark make everything from toy guns that spark to fleshcolored christs that glow in the dark its easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred while preachers preach of evil fates teachers teach that knowledge waits can

them on a footstool just above the plotted plain sayin “take your pick frankie boy my loss will be your gain” well frankie lee he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin but with the cold eyes of judas on him his head began to spin “would ya please not stare at me like that” he said “its just my foolish pride but sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide” well judas he just winked and said “all right ill leave you here but youd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear” “im gonna start my pickin right now just tell me where youll be” judas pointed down the road and said “eternity” “eternity” said frankie lee with a voice as cold as ice “thats right” said judas priest “eternity though you might call it ‘paradise ” “i dont call it anything” said frankie lee with a smile “all right” said judas priest “ill see you after a while” well frankie lee he sat back down feelin low and mean when just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene saying “are you frankie lee the gambler whose father is deceased well if you are theres a fellow callin you down the road and they say his name is priest” “oh yes he is my friend” said

his midnight creep for sixteen nights and days he raved but on the seventeenth he burst into the arms of judas priest which is where he died of thirst no one tried to say a thing when they took him out in jest except of course the little neighbor boy who carried him to rest and he just walked along alone with his guilt so well concealed and muttered underneath his breath “nothing is revealed”

gettin through tangled up in blue she was married when we first met soon to be divorced i helped her out of a jam i guess but i used a little too much force we drove that car as far as we could abandoned it out west split up on a dark sad night both agreeing it was best she turned around to look at me as i was walkin away i heard her say over my shoulder “well meet again someday on the avenue” tangled up in blue i had a job in the great north woods working as a cook for a spell but i never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell so i drifted down to new orleans where i happened to be employed workin for a while on a fishin boat right outside of delacroix but all the while i was alone the past was close behind i seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and i just grew tangled up in blue she was workin in a topless place and i stopped in for a beer i just kept lookin at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear and later on as the crowd thinned out is just about to do the same she was standing there in back of my chair said to me “dont i know your name” i muttered somethin underneath my breath she studied the lines on my face i must admit i felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe tangled up in blue she lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe “i thought youd never say hello” she said “you look like the silent type” then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me written by an italian poet from the thirteenth century and every one of them words rang true and glowed like burnin coal pourin off

lily rosemary and the jack of hearts the festival was over the boys were all plannin for a fall the cabaret was quiet except for the drillin in the wall the curfew had been lifted and the gamblin wheel shut down anyone with any sense had already left town he was standin in the doorway lookin like the jack of hearts he moved across the mirrored room “set it up for everyone” he said then everyone commenced to do what they were doin before he turned their heads then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin “could you kindly tell me friend what time the show begins” then he moved into the corner face down like the jack of hearts backstage the girls were playin fivecard stud by the stairs lily had two queens she was hopin for a third to match her pair outside the streets were fillin up the window was open wide a gentle breeze was blowin you could feel it from inside lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts big jim was no ones fool he owned the towns only diamond mine he made his usual entrance lookin so dandy and so fine with his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place he took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste but his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town she slipped in through the side door lookin like a queen without a crown she fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear “sorry darlin that im late” but he didnt seem to hear he was starin into space over at the jack of hearts “i know ive seen that face before” big jim was thinkin to himself “maybe down in mexico or a picture up on somebodys shelf” but then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim and in the darkness of the room there was only jim and him starin at the butterfly who just drew the jack of hearts lily was a princess she was fairskinned and precious as a child she did whatever she had to do she had that certain flash every time she smiled shed come away from a broken home had lots of strange affairs with men in every walk of life which took her everywhere but shed never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts the hangin judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined the drillin in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind it was known all around that lily had jims ring and nothing would ever come between lily and the king no nothin ever would except maybe the jack of hearts rosemary started drinkin hard and seein her reflection in the knife she was tired of the attention tired of playin the role of big jims wife she had done a lot of bad things even once tried suicide was lookin to do just one good deed before she died she was gazin to the future riding on the jack of hearts lily washed her face took her dress off and buried it away “has your luck run out” she laughed at him “well i guess you must have known it would someday be careful not to touch the wall theres a brandnew coat of paint im glad to see youre still alive youre lookin like a saint” down the hallway footsteps were comin for the jack of hearts the backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair “theres something funny going on” he said “i can just feel it in the air” he went to get the hangin judge but the hangin judge was drunk as the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk there was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts lilys arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch she forgot all about the man she couldnt stand who hounded her so much “ive missed you so” she said to him and he felt she was sincere but just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear just another night in the life of the jack of hearts no one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick the door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked and big jim was standin there ya couldnt say surprised rosemary right beside him steady in her eyes she was with big jim but she was leanin to the jack of hearts two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall and cleaned out the bank safe its said that they got off with quite a haul in the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground for one more member who had business back in town but they couldnt go no further without the jack of hearts the next day was hangin day the sky was overcast and black big jim lay covered up killed by a penknife in the back and rosemary on the gallows she didnt even blink the hangin judge was sober he hadnt had a drink the only person on the scene missin was the jack of hearts the cabaret was empty now a sign said “closed for repair” lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair she was thinkin bout her father who she very rarely saw thinkin bout rosemary and thinkin about the law but most of all she was thinkin bout the jack of hearts,dylan,lily rosemary and the jack of hearts the festival was over the boys were all plannin for a

hurricane with jacques levy pistol shots ring out in the barroom night enter patty valentine from the upper hall she sees the bartender in a pool of blood cries out “my god they killed them all” here comes the story of the hurricane the man the authorities came to blame for somethin that he never done put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been the champion of the world three bodies lyin there does patty see and another man named bello movin around mysteriously “i didnt do it” he says and he throws up his hands “i was only robbin the register i hope you understand i saw them leavin” he says and he stops “one of us had better call up the cops” and so patty calls the cops and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin in the hot new jersey night meanwhile far away in another part of town rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin around number one contender for the middleweight crown had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road just like the time before and the time before that in paterson thats just the way things go if youre black you might as well not show up on the street less you wanna draw the heat alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowlin around he said “i saw two men runnin out they looked like middleweights they jumped into a white car with outofstate plates” and miss patty valentine just nodded her head cop said “wait a minute boys this ones not dead” so they took him to the infirmary and though this man could hardly see they told him that he could identify the guilty men four in the mornin and they haul rubin in take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs the wounded man looks up through his one dyin eye says “whad you bring him in here for he aint the guy” yes heres the story of the hurricane the man the authorities came to blame for somethin that he never done put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been the champion of the world four months later the ghettos are in flame rubins in south america fightin for his name while arthur dexter bradleys still in the robbery game and the cops are puttin the screws to him lookin for somebody to blame “remember that murder that happened in a bar” “remember you said you saw the getaway car” “you think youd like to play ball with the law” “think it mighta been that fighter that you saw runnin that night” “dont forget that you are white” arthur dexter bradley said “im really not sure” cops said “a poor boy like you could use a break we got you for the motel job and were talkin to your friend bello now you dont wanta have to go back to jail be a nice fellow youll be doin society a favor that sonofabitch is brave and gettin braver we want to put his ass in stir we want to pin this triple murder on him he aint no gentleman jim” rubin could take a man out with just one punch but he never did like to talk about it all that much its my work hed say and i do it for pay and when its over id just as soon go on my way up to some paradise where the trout streams flow and the air is nice and ride a horse along a trail but then they took him to the jailhouse where they try to turn a man into a mouse all of rubins cards were marked in advance the trial was a pigcircus he never had a chance the judge made rubins witnesses drunkards from the slums to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger no one doubted that he pulled the trigger and though they could not produce the gun the da said he was the one who did the deed and the allwhite jury agreed rubin carter was falsely tried the crime was murder “one” guess who testified bello and bradley and they both baldly lied and the newspapers they all went along for the ride how can the life of such a man be in the palm of some fools hand to see him obviously framed couldnt help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game now all the criminals in their coats and their ties are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise while rubin sits like buddha in a tenfoot cell an innocent man in a

black diamond bay with jacques levy up on the white veranda she wears a necktie and a panama hat her passport shows a face from another time and place she looks nothin like that and all the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind she walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is callin her to come on in she smiles walks the other way as the last ship sails and the moon fades away from black diamond bay as the mornin light breaks open the greek comes down and he asks for a rope and a pen that will write “pardon monsieur” the desk clerk says carefully removes his fez “am i hearin you right” and as the yellow fog is liftin the greek is quickly headin for the second floor she passes him on the spiral staircase thinkin hes the soviet ambassador she starts to speak but he walks away as the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on black diamond bay a soldier sits beneath the fan doin business with a tiny man who sells him a ring lightning strikes the lights blow out the desk clerk wakes and begins to shout “can you see anything” then the greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck while a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle says “open up another deck” but the dealer says “attendezvous sil vous plaît” as the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from black diamond bay the desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough he tried to grab the womans hand said “heres a ring it cost a grand” she said “that aint enough” then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horsedrawn taxi waited at the curb she passed the door that the greek had locked where a handwritten sign read “do not disturb” she knocked upon it anyway as the sun went down and the music did play on black diamond bay “ive got to talk to someone quick” but the greek said “go away” and he kicked the chair to the floor he hung there from the chandelier she cried “help theres danger near please open up the door” then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above the soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love but the desk clerk said “it happens every day” as the stars fell down and the fields burned away on black diamond bay as the island slowly sank the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room the dealer said “its too late now you can take your money but i dont know how youll spend it in the tomb” the tiny man bit the soldiers ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew while shes out on the balcony where a stranger tells her “my darling je vous aime beaucoup” she sheds a tear and then begins to pray as the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away from black diamond bay i was sittin home alone one night in la watchin old cronkite on the seven oclock news it seems there was an earthquake that left nothin but a panama hat and a pair of old greek

highlands well my hearts in the highlands gentle and fair honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air bluebells blazing where the aberdeen waters flow well my hearts in the highlands im gonna go there when i feel good enough to go windows were shakin all night in my dreams everything was exactly the way that it seems woke up this morning and i looked at the same old page same ol rat race life in the same ol cage i dont want nothing from anyone aint that much to take wouldnt know the difference between a real blonde and a fake feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery i wish someone would come and push back the clock for me well my hearts in the highlands wherever i roam thats where ill be when i get called home the wind it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme well my hearts in the highlands i can only get there one step at a time im listening to neil young i gotta turn up the sound someones always yelling turn it down feel like im drifting drifting from scene to scene im wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean insanity is smashing up against my soul you can say i was on anything but a roll if i had a conscience well i just might blow my top what would i do with it anyway maybe take it to the pawn shop my hearts in the highlands at the break of dawn by the beautiful lake of the black swan big white clouds like chariots that swing down low well my hearts in the highlands only place left to go im in boston town in some restaurant i got no idea what i want well maybe i do but im just really not sure waitress comes over nobody in the place but me and her it must be a holiday theres nobody around she studies me closely as i sit down she got a pretty face and long white shiny legs she says “whatll it be” i say “i dont know you got any soft boiled eggs” she looks at me says “id bring you some but were out of m you picked the wrong time to come” then she says “i know youre an artist draw a picture of me” i say “i would if i could but i dont do sketches from memory” “well” she says “im right here in front of you or havent you looked” i say “all right i know but i dont have my drawing book” she gives me a napkin she says “you can do it on that” i say “yes i could but i dont know where my pencil is at” she pulls one out from behind her ear she says “all right now go ahead draw me im standing right here” i make a few lines and i show it for her to see well she takes the napkin and throws it back and says “that dont look a thing like me” i said “oh kind miss it most certainly does” she says “you must be jokin” i say “i wish i was” then she says “you dont read women authors do you” least thats what i think i hear her say “well” i say “how would you know and what would it matter anyway” “well” she says “you just dont seem like you do” i said “youre way wrong” she says “which ones have you read then” i say “i read erica jong” she goes away for a minute and i slide up out of my chair i step outside back to the busy street but nobodys going anywhere well my hearts in the highlands with the horses and hounds way up in the border country far from the towns with the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow my hearts in the highlands cant see any other way to go every day is the same thing out the door feel further away than ever before some things in life it gets too late to learn well im lost somewhere i must have made a few bad turns i see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes theyre drinking and dancing wearing brightcolored clothes all the young men with their young women looking so good well id trade places with any of them in a minute if i could im crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog talking to myself in a monologue i think what i need might be a fulllength leather coat somebody just asked me if i registered to vote the sun is beginning to shine on me but its not like the sun that used to be the partys over and theres less and less to say i got new eyes everything looks far away well my hearts in the highlands at the break of day over the hills and far away theres a way to get there and ill figure it out somehow but im already there in my mind and thats good enough for now,dylan,highlands well my hearts in the highlands gentle and fair honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air bluebells blazing where the aberdeen waters flow well my hearts in the highlands

cross the green mountain from the film gods and generals i crossed the green mountain i slept by the stream heaven blazin in my head i dreamt a monstrous dream something came up out of the sea swept through the land of the rich and the free i look into the eyes of my merciful friend and then i ask myself is this the end memories linger sad yet sweet and i think of the souls in heaven who will meet altars are burning with flames falling wide the foe has crossed over from the other side they tip their caps from the top of the hill you can feel them come more brave blood to spill along the

be learned in a day i watch and i wait and i listen while i stand to the music that comes from a far better land close the eyes of our captain peace may he know his long night is done the great leader is laid low he was ready to fall he was quick to defend killed outright he was by his own men its the last days last hour of the last happy year i feel that the unknown world is so near pride will vanish and glory will rot but virtue lives and cannot be forgot the bells of evening have rung theres blasphemy on every tongue let them say that i walked in fair natures light and that i was loyal to truth and to right serve god and be cheerful look upward beyond beyond the darkness that masks the surprises of dawn in the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood they never dreamed of surrendering they fell where they stood stars fell over alabama i saw each star youre walkin in dreams whoever you are chilled are the skies keen is the frost the grounds froze hard and the morning is lost a letter to mother came today gunshot wound to the breast is what it did say but hell be better soon hes in a hospital bed but hell never be better hes already dead im ten miles outside the city

tin angel it was late last night when the boss came home to a deserted mansion and a desolate throne servant said “boss the ladys gone she left this morning just fore dawn” “you got something to tell me tell it to me man come to the point as straight as you can” “old henry lee chief of the clan came riding through the woods and took her by the hand” the boss he laid back flat on his bed he cursed the heat and he clutched his head he pondered the future of his fate to wait another day would be far too late “go fetch me my coat and my tie and the cheapest labor that money can buy saddle me up my buckskin mare if you see me go by put up a prayer” well they rode all night and they rode all day eastward long on the broad highway his spirit was tired and his vision was bent his men deserted him

crosshandled sword he renounced his faith he denied his lord crawled on his belly put his ear to the wall one way or another hed put an end to it all he leaned down cut the electric wire stared into the flames and he snorted the fire peered through the darkness caught a glimpse of the two it was hard to tell for certain who was who he lowered himself down on a golden chain his nerves were quaking in every vein his knuckles were bloody he sucked in the air he ran his fingers through his greasy hair they looked at each other and their glasses clinked one single unit inseparably linked “got a strange premonition theres a man close by” “dont worry about him he wouldnt harm a fly” from behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor he moved his feet and he bolted the door shadows hiding the lines in his face with all the nobility of an ancient race she turned she was startled with a look of surprise with a hatred that could hit the skies “youre a reckless fool i can see it in your eyes to come this way was by no means wise” “get up stand up you greedy lipped wench and cover your face or suffer the consequence you are making my heart full sick put your clothes back on double quick”

dear you must be blind hes a gutless ape with a worthless mind” “you had your way too long with me now its me wholl determine how things shall be try to escape” he cussed and cursed “youll have to try to get past me first” “i dare not let your passion rule you think my heart the heart of a fool and you sir you cannot deny you made a monkey of me what and for why” “ill have no more of this insulting chat the devil can have you ill see to that look sharp or step aside or in the cradle youll wish you died” the gun went boom and the shot rang clear first bullet grazed his ear second ball went right straight in and he bent in the middle like a twisted pin he crawled to the corner and he lowered his head he gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed it would take more than needle and thread bleeding from the mouth hes as good as dead “you shot my husband down you fiend” “husband what husband what the hell do you mean he was a man of strife a man of sin i cut him down and ill throw him to the wind” “hear this” she said with angry breath “you too shall meet the lord of death it was i who brought your soul to life” and she raised her robe and she drew out a knife his face was hard and caked

body and thought all husbands are good men as all wives know” then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow his knees went limp and he reached for the door his doom was sealed he slid to the floor he whispered in her ear “this is all your fault my fighting days have come to a halt” she touched his lip and kissed his cheek he tried to speak but his breath was weak “you died for me now
